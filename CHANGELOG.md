## N.N.N (YYYY-MM-DD)

> Committed but unreleased changes are put here, at the top. Older releases are detailed chronologically below. 

#### Changed

- Change colour of `:focus` outline on non-native components such as `button` and `single-dropdown`
- `simple-v-table` sortable column icons now only appear on hover. **Requires copying updated `re-com.css` to your project.**

#### Added

- Add parts to tag-dropdown for internal selection-list
- Add simple-v-table striped? argument

## 2.13.2 (2021-02-24)

#### Fixed

- Fix `re-com.core/at` macro availability via `:refer` so you can now simply do:
```clojure
(:require
  [re-com.core :refer [at]])
```
- Fix `re-com.core/at` macro eliding (i.e. return nil) in production builds.
- Fix logging of source urls in validation errors or `stack-spy` when no
  `re-com.config/root-url-for-compiler-output` Closure Define is provided in
  the compiler configuration; i.e. do not log the URL as missing the required
  information to create a valid URL.

## 2.13.1 (2021-02-24)

#### Fixed

- Fix `datepicker-dropdown` exception. Regression in 2.13.0. 

## 2.13.0 (2021-02-23)

When upgrading any app to use this version, please update the following:
   - `re-com.css`
   - `css/material-design-iconic-font.min.css`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.eot`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.svg`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.woff`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.woff2`

#### Added

- Add new debugging features, including the new `:src` parameter. [The debug page](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/debug) explains more.  Note: where previously parameter validation errors raised exceptions, now components instead draw themselves as a red, placeholder box, and write error information to the devtools console. This is a gentler, more informative approach - exceptions are too jarring and result in a blizzard of confusing React stack traces in the console.
- Add a new compiler configuration `re-com.config/root-url-for-compiler-output`. [The config page](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/config) explains more.
- Add column sorting feature to `[simple-v-table]`. Column specifications can now, optionally include a `:sort-by` key.
- Add new arguments to `[tag-dropdown]` including `:required?` ,`:min-width`, `:max-width`, `:abbrev-fn` and `:abbrev-characters`.
- Add the argument `:split-is-px?` to `[splitter]`.  See [#178](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/178)
- Add year navigation buttons to `[datepicker]`. See [#109](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/109#issuecomment-770462387) **Breaking** the HTML structure for the `datepicker` navigation section was changed and
  certain CSS classes have been renamed/changed. If you have custom CSS selectors targeting these parts, you'll need to edit as follows:
   - `available` to `rc-datepicker-selectable`
   - `disabled` to `rc-datepicker-disabled`
   - `off` to `rc-datepicker-unselectable` (for unselectable days) or `rc-datepicker-out-of-focus` (for days not in the current month)
   - `selected` to `rc-datepicker-selected`
   - `today` to `rc-datepicker-today`.

#### Fixed

- Previously, the argument and parts description data structures (for each component) were incorrectly included into production builds. This is now fixed. 
  (i.e. when `js/GOOG.debug` is false).
- `[datepicker]` week number calculation with arbitrary `:start-of-week` argument. See [#159](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/159)
- `[tag-dropdown]` popover alignment is now centered under the component, rather than off to the left.
- Fix the `disabled? true` state styling of `[tag-dropdown]`
- Fix the `disabled? true` state styling of `[datepicker]`
- `[alert-list]` no longer ignores individual alert `:style` argument. See [#83](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/83)

#### Changed

- Upgrade Material Design Iconic Font to [2.2.0](https://github.com/zavoloklom/material-design-iconic-font/releases/tag/2.2.0). See [#253](https://github.com/day8/re-com/pull/253). Thanks to [@esnyder](https://github.com/esnyder).

##### `[text/p]`

- `[text/p]` is now an alias to `[text/p-span]`.  Externally this means no change. But interally, it is implemented using `[:span]` instead of `[:p]` (allowing you to embed `boxes` etc).  **Breaking** Because of the change in HTML elements used, your custom CSS selectors targetting `p` elements will have to be changed to target `span.rc-p`. 
  
##### `[tag-dropdown]`

- **Breaking**
  - Removed the `tag-dropdown` arguments `:tag-width`, `:tag-height`, `:tag-comp` and `:on-tag-click`. To fix, remove
  use of these arguments from your code.
  - Changed default of `:unselect-buttons?` to `false`, if you want to maintain the old behaviour then add
  `:unselect-buttons? true` to the arguments passed to the component.

##### `[v-table]` and `[simple-v-table]`

Both of these components are still `Alpha`. Iterative improvements have continued
causing some breaking changes.

- **Breaking**:
  - Argument renames. This will break any CLJS code that pass the arguments to the components. To fix, change the arg
  to use the new name:
    - `:header-renderer` arg of `simple-v-table` to `:column-header-renderer`
    - `:max-table-width` arg of `v-table` and `simple-v-table` to `:max-width`
    - `:scroll-cols-into-view` arg of `v-table`  to `:scroll-cols-into-view`
    - `:col-header-renderer` arg of `v-table`  to `:column-header-renderer`
    - `:col-header-height` arg of `v-table`  to `:column-header-height`
    - `:col-header-selection-fn` arg of `v-table`  to `:column-header-selection-fn`
    - `:parts` args that match  `:v-table-*` to `:*` (in other words, remove `v-table-`)
    - `:parts` args that match  `:*-col-*` to `:*-column-*`
    - `:id-fn` arg has been renamed `:key-fn` and its default has been changed from `:id` to `nil`. If you leave it blank or pass nil, it will use the row's internally generated 0-based row-index instead of :key-fn
    - `:style-parts` arg of `v-table`  to `:parts`
      - Then wrap any style maps in a map with a key of `:style`. For example:
        ```clojure
           :style-parts {:v-table {:background-color "lightgrey"}}

           ;; becomes...

           :parts {:wrapper {:style {:background-color "lightgrey"}}}

           ;; notice, the above also included a :v-table => :wrapper conversion 
        ```

  - Rename `:valign` in `simple-v-table` `:columns` specification to `:vertical-align` to
match the associated CSS property. Fix the documentation and demos of the same.
  - `:attr-parts` arg of `v-table` has been removed. You need to incorporate it into the `:parts` arg. For example:
    ```clojure
    :attr-parts {:v-table-top-left {:on-click (handler-fn ...)}}
    
    ;; becomes...
    
    :parts {:top-left {:attr {:on-click (handler-fn ...)}}}
    
    ;; notice, the above also included a :v-table-top-left => :top-left conversion 
    ```

## 2.12.0 (2021-01-23)

#### Fixed

- Fix v-table as `:model` deref was broken in last release.
- Fix `[multi-select]` and `[selection-list]` scrolling when `disabled?` 
- Fix `[datepicker]` styling of disabled/unselectable vs days out of the current month

#### Removed

- **Breaking**
  - Remove `re-com.misc` ns. Replaced by `re-com.checkbox`, `re-com.input-text`, `re-com.radio-button`, `re-com.slider`,
  `re-com.progress-bar` and `re-com.slider`. If you require `re-com.misc` directly in your code, instead of using the
  aliases in `re-com.core`, then you will need to change that to the appropriate new namespace reference(s).

## 2.11.0 (2021-01-23)

#### Added

- Add `tag-dropdown`. See [https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/tag-dropdown](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/tag-dropdown).
