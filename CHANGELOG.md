## 2.22.0 (2024-09-28)

#### Changed

- `single-dropdown` - No longer aligns itself at the beginning of a flex container (i.e., removed ``align-self: flex-start`).
- `nested-grid` - Row-header labels are now sticky within their grid areas.

## 2.21.27 (2024-09-05)

#### Fixed

- Reverted `tree-select-dropdown`. Identical to 2.21.25.


## 2.21.26 (2024-09-05)

#### Changed
- `tree-select-dropdown` - Dynamic sizing WIP.

## 2.21.25 (2024-09-05)

#### Changed

- `nested-grid` - Export button stays mounted, even when `:show-export-button?` is off.
  This is useful when automating the export behavior by targeting the button with a click event.
- `nested-grid` - Exports now make use of the `:cell-value` function by default.
- `nested-grid` - `:on-export-column-header` now accepts a `:column-path` prop (same for `:on-export-row-header`).


## 2.21.24 (2024-09-05)

#### Changed

- `tree-select-dropdown` - Renamed most of the parts (still unstable).

#### Fixed

- `nested-grid` - Fixed missing cell borders
- Fixed parts system not working in some alpha components.

## 2.21.23 (2024-09-02)

- `nested-grid` - `:theme-cells?` prop, useful to optimize render performance.

#### Fixed
- `nested-grid` - Optimized performance.

## 2.21.22 (2024-08-29)

#### Fixed
- `nested-grid` - Header grid sizes are more correct.

## 2.21.21 (2024-08-22)

#### Fixed
- `nested-grid` - nested headers render correctly again.


## 2.21.20 (2024-08-21)

#### Added
- `nested-grid` - More parts, better themeing support
- `nested-grid` - optional `:align` key for column-specs.

#### Fixed

- `nested-grid` - resizing columns works again (without rendering every cell).

## 2.21.19 (2024-08-19)

#### Added
- `single-dropdown` - `:drop-direction` prop. Overrides any behavior which would position the body dynamically. `:up` or `:above` positions the body above the anchor, `:down`, `:dn` or `:below` positions it below.
- `nested-grid` - optional `:align-column` & `:align-column-header` keys for column-specs.

## 2.21.18 (2024-08-09)

#### Fixed
- `single-dropdown` - `:can-drop-above?` now works again.

## 2.21.17 (2024-08-07)

#### Added
- `dropdown` - New `:show-backdrop`? prop. Defaults to `nil`.

#### Changed

- `dropdown` - The `:backdrop` part is now purely visual. Clicking outside the anchor or body still closes the dropdown. Instead of `:backdrop`, a global event handler now handles this behavior.

## 2.21.16 (2024-08-05)

#### Added

- `datepicker-dropdown` - `:parts` can now target the `:anchor-label` part.
- `datepicker-dropdown` - Added an optional `:date-cell` argument. This is one of the new "part" arguments, acceping a string, a hiccup or a reagent component function.

## 2.21.15 (2024-07-26)

#### Changed

- `dropdown` - Removed `:line-height` style from the theme. `:line-height` was left-over from old bootstrap css. Bootstrap used it to achieve a semblance of vertical centering of text in the anchor. Since we use a re-com box, we can do vertical centering in a nicer way.

- `dropdown` - More consistent handling of width/height props. `:width` applies to both anchor and body, while `:height` applies only to the body. You can override this behavior for specific parts using `:anchor-width`, `:anchor-height`, `:body-width` and `:body-height`.

## 2.21.14 (2024-07-25)

#### Added

- `dropdown` - `:height`, `:body-height` & `:body-width` props

## 2.21.13 (2024-07-23)

#### Added

- New `error-modal` component (alpha).


## 2.21.12 (2024-07-20)

#### Fixed

- `dropdown` - Always drops down when not clipping. Before, this component would choose a body position closest to the vertical center of the viewport. Now, it chooses a position below the anchor, unless that would cause the body to clip.
- `simple-v-table` - Renamed `:row-export-fn` to `:on-export-row-label-fn`.

## 2.21.11 (2024-07-11)

#### Fixed

- `tree-select-dropdown` - Fixed a runtime error when `:expanded-groups` is not passed.

## 2.21.10 (2024-07-11)

#### Changed

- `tree-select-dropdown` - Now the anchor label uses a `:span`, and doesn't underline on hover. 


## 2.21.9 (2024-07-10)

#### Changed

- `tree-select-dropdown` - Tweaked styling, expanded the `:label` part (alpha).


## 2.21.8 (2024-07-09)

#### Added

- `tree-select-dropdown` - Added `:on-group-expand`, `:expanded-groups` & `:show-only-button?` props.

## 2.21.7 (2024-07-07)

#### Added

- `tree-select-dropdown` - Added `:required?`, `:show-reset-button?`, `:on-reset`, `:body-header` & `:body-footer` props.`


## 2.21.6 (2024-06-29)

#### Fixed

- `single-dropdown` - Fixed disabled style. Now disabled dropdowns appear greyed-out again.
- `tree-select` - Fixed expander buttons not showing up in some browsers. Now they use svg, not unicode chars.
- `single-dropdown` - Adjusted triangle indicator. Now uses svg, not a sprite.


## 2.21.5 (2024-06-10)

#### Fixed

- `tree-select` - Fixed non-responsive behavior when passing `:model` as value, (not a reagent/atom).


## 2.21.4 (2024-05-14)

#### Fixed

- `simple-v-table` - Removed default header-labels, since they show up badly in existing apps. (#340)


## 2.21.3 (2024-05-09)

#### Fixed

- Crash when declaring :sort-by for simple-v-table headers in top-left section

## 2.21.2 (2024-05-09)

#### Fixed

- Invisible icons & broken execution in simple-v-table headers (#339)


## 2.21.0 (2024-04-24)

#### Added

- New tooling, using `bb.edn` and `deps.edn`.

#### Fixed

- `simple-v-table` column headers now are now :vertical-align "center"

## 2.16.3 (2024-01-19)

#### Fixed

- `simple-v-table` column headers now :align correctly. Also, :vertical-align now only affects cells, not headers.

## 2.16.2 (2024-01-16)

#### Fixed

- Replace deprecated `r/dom-node` with ref callbacks. (#329, #334) Thanks [RolT](https://github.com/RolT) for PR.

#### Changed

- Change colour of `:focus` outline on non-native components such as `button` and `single-dropdown`

## 2.13.2 (2021-02-24)

#### Fixed

- Fix `re-com.core/at` macro availability via `:refer` so you can now simply do:
```clojure
(:require
  [re-com.core :refer [at]])
```
- Fix `re-com.core/at` macro eliding (i.e. return nil) in production builds.
- Fix logging of source urls in validation errors or `stack-spy` when no
  `re-com.config/root-url-for-compiler-output` Closure Define is provided in
  the compiler configuration; i.e. do not log the URL as missing the required
  information to create a valid URL.

## 2.13.1 (2021-02-24)

#### Fixed

- Fix `datepicker-dropdown` exception. Regression in 2.13.0. 

## 2.13.0 (2021-02-23)

When upgrading any app to use this version, please update the following:
   - `re-com.css`
   - `css/material-design-iconic-font.min.css`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.eot`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.svg`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.woff`
   - `fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.woff2`

#### Added

- Add new debugging features, including the new `:src` parameter. [The debug page](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/debug) explains more.  Note: where previously parameter validation errors raised exceptions, now components instead draw themselves as a red, placeholder box, and write error information to the devtools console. This is a gentler, more informative approach - exceptions are too jarring and result in a blizzard of confusing React stack traces in the console.
- Add a new compiler configuration `re-com.config/root-url-for-compiler-output`. [The config page](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/config) explains more.
- Add column sorting feature to `[simple-v-table]`. Column specifications can now, optionally include a `:sort-by` key.
- Add new arguments to `[tag-dropdown]` including `:required?` ,`:min-width`, `:max-width`, `:abbrev-fn` and `:abbrev-characters`.
- Add the argument `:split-is-px?` to `[splitter]`.  See [#178](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/178)
- Add year navigation buttons to `[datepicker]`. See [#109](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/109#issuecomment-770462387) **Breaking** the HTML structure for the `datepicker` navigation section was changed and
  certain CSS classes have been renamed/changed. If you have custom CSS selectors targeting these parts, you'll need to edit as follows:
   - `available` to `rc-datepicker-selectable`
   - `disabled` to `rc-datepicker-disabled`
   - `off` to `rc-datepicker-unselectable` (for unselectable days) or `rc-datepicker-out-of-focus` (for days not in the current month)
   - `selected` to `rc-datepicker-selected`
   - `today` to `rc-datepicker-today`.

#### Fixed

- Previously, the argument and parts description data structures (for each component) were incorrectly included into production builds. This is now fixed. 
  (i.e. when `js/GOOG.debug` is false).
- `[datepicker]` week number calculation with arbitrary `:start-of-week` argument. See [#159](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/159)
- `[tag-dropdown]` popover alignment is now centered under the component, rather than off to the left.
- Fix the `disabled? true` state styling of `[tag-dropdown]`
- Fix the `disabled? true` state styling of `[datepicker]`
- `[alert-list]` no longer ignores individual alert `:style` argument. See [#83](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/83)

#### Changed

- Upgrade Material Design Iconic Font to [2.2.0](https://github.com/zavoloklom/material-design-iconic-font/releases/tag/2.2.0). See [#253](https://github.com/day8/re-com/pull/253). Thanks to [@esnyder](https://github.com/esnyder).

##### `[text/p]`

- `[text/p]` is now an alias to `[text/p-span]`.  Externally this means no change. But interally, it is implemented using `[:span]` instead of `[:p]` (allowing you to embed `boxes` etc).  **Breaking** Because of the change in HTML elements used, your custom CSS selectors targetting `p` elements will have to be changed to target `span.rc-p`. 
  
##### `[tag-dropdown]`

- **Breaking**
  - Removed the `tag-dropdown` arguments `:tag-width`, `:tag-height`, `:tag-comp` and `:on-tag-click`. To fix, remove
  use of these arguments from your code.
  - Changed default of `:unselect-buttons?` to `false`, if you want to maintain the old behaviour then add
  `:unselect-buttons? true` to the arguments passed to the component.

##### `[v-table]` and `[simple-v-table]`

Both of these components are still `Alpha`. Iterative improvements have continued
causing some breaking changes.

- **Breaking**:
  - Argument renames. This will break any CLJS code that pass the arguments to the components. To fix, change the arg
  to use the new name:
    - `:header-renderer` arg of `simple-v-table` to `:column-header-renderer`
    - `:max-table-width` arg of `v-table` and `simple-v-table` to `:max-width`
    - `:scroll-cols-into-view` arg of `v-table`  to `:scroll-cols-into-view`
    - `:col-header-renderer` arg of `v-table`  to `:column-header-renderer`
    - `:col-header-height` arg of `v-table`  to `:column-header-height`
    - `:col-header-selection-fn` arg of `v-table`  to `:column-header-selection-fn`
    - `:parts` args that match  `:v-table-*` to `:*` (in other words, remove `v-table-`)
    - `:parts` args that match  `:*-col-*` to `:*-column-*`
    - `:id-fn` arg has been renamed `:key-fn` and its default has been changed from `:id` to `nil`. If you leave it blank or pass nil, it will use the row's internally generated 0-based row-index instead of :key-fn
    - `:style-parts` arg of `v-table`  to `:parts`
      - Then wrap any style maps in a map with a key of `:style`. For example:
        ```clojure
           :style-parts {:v-table {:background-color "lightgrey"}}

           ;; becomes...

           :parts {:wrapper {:style {:background-color "lightgrey"}}}

           ;; notice, the above also included a :v-table => :wrapper conversion 
        ```

  - Rename `:valign` in `simple-v-table` `:columns` specification to `:vertical-align` to
match the associated CSS property. Fix the documentation and demos of the same.
  - `:attr-parts` arg of `v-table` has been removed. You need to incorporate it into the `:parts` arg. For example:
    ```clojure
    :attr-parts {:v-table-top-left {:on-click (handler-fn ...)}}
    
    ;; becomes...
    
    :parts {:top-left {:attr {:on-click (handler-fn ...)}}}
    
    ;; notice, the above also included a :v-table-top-left => :top-left conversion 
    ```

## 2.12.0 (2021-01-23)

#### Fixed

- Fix v-table as `:model` deref was broken in last release.
- Fix `[multi-select]` and `[selection-list]` scrolling when `disabled?` 
- Fix `[datepicker]` styling of disabled/unselectable vs days out of the current month

#### Removed

- **Breaking**
  - Remove `re-com.misc` ns. Replaced by `re-com.checkbox`, `re-com.input-text`, `re-com.radio-button`, `re-com.slider`,
  `re-com.progress-bar` and `re-com.slider`. If you require `re-com.misc` directly in your code, instead of using the
  aliases in `re-com.core`, then you will need to change that to the appropriate new namespace reference(s).

## 2.11.0 (2021-01-23)

#### Added

- Add `:parts` argument to all components that are constructed from a hierarchy of elements. See 'Parts' section of 
  component pages at [https://re-com.day8.com.au/](https://re-com.day8.com.au/). 
- Add `multi-select`. See [https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/multi-select](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/multi-select).

  [https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/simple-v-table](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/simple-v-table).
- Add `tag-dropdown`. See [https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/tag-dropdown](https://re-com.day8.com.au/#/tag-dropdown).
- Add optional 2-arity variant of `on-change` to `input-text`. Fixes [#219](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/219).

#### Changed

- Improved `disabled?` styling of many components.

## 2.10.1 (2020-12-22)

- Add tooltip to horizontal-bar-tabs & :validate?. See [#199](https://github.com/day8/re-com/pull/199)

#### Fixed

- Remove reset! of external-model in input-text-base event handlers. Fixes [#219](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/219)
  Caused regression of [#187](https://github.com/day8/re-com/issues/187). Fixed in 2.11.0.
