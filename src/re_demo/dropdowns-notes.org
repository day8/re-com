** [::sdd/outer ::sdd/disabled]
A combined part/state query: ~[part & state-query]~.
Might be non-obvious where part ends & state begins.
As long as parts is a flat structure, it should be alright.
Otherwise, might have to do ~[[& part-query] [& state-query]]~.

** ::sdd/outer {:margin-left 20}
Target a part without targeting any state.
In this case, the css rule applies in all states.
