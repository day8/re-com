What's the value prop? Convenience?

Seems like it adds complexity.
Might be nicer to spec validate the args, rather than coercing them.

** (for [[k v] map                         :let [v (if (= k :class) (string/join " " v) v)]                         itm [k v]]                     itm)
consider extracting this. Also, I guess we won't need this whole adapter once we switch the api to regular reagent props maps.
