### WARNING

> Do NOT use this script. It has been created in preparation for a future re-com change. No version of re-com 
> (including master branch) is compatible with the changes made by this script.

This script will recursively traverse all the ClojureScript files in an existing codebase, finding all uses of 
re-com components and, for each, transforming keyword args into a map. 

So, existing code like this:
```clojure
[v-box
  :size     "auto"
  :gap      "10px"
  :children [...]]
```

will be changed to
```clojure
[v-box  {                       ;; <-- this is wrapped in a map
  :size     "auto"
  :gap      "10px" } [...]]     ;; <-- The child is added outside the map
```

(And, before you ask, no, we didn't find a way to preserve indentation after the formatting).

This script is clever enough to detect when a component is already in hiccup like structure and as a result, it can 
be run multiple times on a codebase.

### To Run This Script

1. Install [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) 0.3.2 or later by following [these instructions](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation).

2. Clone re-com's GitHub repository,

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/day8/re-com.git 
   ```

3. Navigate to the scripts location
   ```
   cd re-com/scripts/kwargs-to-map/ 
   ```

4. Run the script with babashka (aka `bb`)

   If the codebase using re-com had sources in `../my-project/src`, then run:
   ```
   bb kwargs_to_map.clj "../my-project/src" 
   ```

5. Inspect the files in the `src` directory. Notice the updates made.

#### Tip

For run, (not test command in the next section) the `bb` command also takes the following extra command line 
arguments after the directory.

1. `--verbose` or `-v`. When this is passed, the changes the script makes are printed to console. Example command
   ```sh 
   bb kwargs-to-map.clj "../my-project/src" --verbose
   ```

2. `--testing` or `-t`. When this is passed, the files that the script edits are not saved to disk but printed to console
   ```sh 
   bb kwargs_to_map.clj "../my-project/src" --testing
   ```
   Note, When `-testing` is passed, `-verbose` is always true.

3. `--help` or `-h`. Print the help menu. Example command
   ```sh
   bb kwargs_to_map.clj --help
   ```

### Test script
1. Install [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) 0.3.2 or later by following [these instructions](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation).

2. Navigate to the scripts location
   ```
   cd re-com/scripts/kwargs-to-map/ 
   ```

3. Run the test script with babashka,
   ```
   bb test/test-runner.clj 
   ```
 
### What It Does 

The following section documents how the script edits your files
- The re-com components, `p` and `p-span` do not receive any editing
- The re-com components below are considered to have the child which is the indicated key
  - `modal-panel`        -> `:child`
  - `alert-box`          -> `:body`
  - `box`                -> `:child`
  - `scroller`           -> `:child`
  - `border`             -> `:child`
  - `checkbox`           -> `:label`

During editing, the keyword args are added to a map and then the child is conjoined after.
For example the `box` below,
```Clojure
[re-com/box :src (at)
  :size "1"
  :child [border
          :border "1px dashed red"
          :child  [box :height "100px" :child "Hello"]]
  :align :center]
```

is transformed to 
```Clojure
[re-com/box { :src (at)                                                        <== the map is added
  :size "1"
  :align :center } [border {                                                     <== child is conjoined after the map with the same effects
          :border "1px dashed red" } [box { :height "100px" } "Hello"]]]
```

The space is only preserved in the first child i.e (`box`). 

- The following re-com components are assumed to have the key `:children`
  - `h-box`
  - `v-box`

Their keyword arguments are added to a map and then the children are conjoined recursively after the map. 
For example the `v-box` below
```Clojure
[v-box :src (at)
 :size    "1"
 :justify  :center
 :children [[re-com/v-box :src (at)
             :size     "1"
             :children [[label :title "Moved"]]
             :align    :center]
```

is transformed to
```Clojure
[v-box { :src (at)                                                         <== map is added
 :size     "1"
 :justify  :center } [re-com/v-box { :src (at)                   <== children are added after the map
             :size     "1"
             :align    :center } [label :title "Moved"]]
```
Spacing is only preserved in the first child.


- The following are treated as splits
  - `h-split`
  - `v-split`

Their keys `:panel-1` and `panel-2` are conjoined in the right order outside the map.
For example consider the `h-split`
```Clojure
[rc/h-split :src (at)
 :panel-1 [left-panel]
 :panel-2 [right-panel]
 :size    "300px"]
```

It is transformed to
```Clojure
[rc/h-split { :src (at)                                                                      <== the map is added
 :size    "300px" } [left-panel] [right-panel]]                                 <== the panels are added after the map
```
Space is preserved within the map

- All other components are treated as to have no special reformatting and all their keyword arguments are wrapped in a map preserving whitespace.
For example a button like
```Clojure
[button
 :label    "This is the label"
 :style    {:color "red"}
 :on-click nil
 :class    "class-name"]
```

is edited as follows
```Clojure
[button {                                                        <== the map is added
 :label    "This is the label"
 :style    {:color "red"}
 :on-click nil
 :class    "class-name" } ]
```
