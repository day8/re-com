----------|--------|--------
`master` | [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Day8/re-com/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Day8/re-com/tree/master) | `[re-com "0.9.0"]`

A ClojureScript library of UI components.

It is built on top of Dan Holmsand's terrific
[Reagent](http://reagent-project.github.io)
which, in turn, is a layer over Facebook's trailblazing [React](http://facebook.github.io/react).

Just to be clear: this library is 100% ClojureScript. We're not wrapping jQuery plugins here.

Re-com has:

* familiar UI widgetry **components** such as dropdowns, date pickers, popovers, tabs, etc.
* layout **components**, which arrange widgets vertically and horizontally, within
  splitters, etc. Plus components
  which put borders around their children. These various pieces can be arbitrarily nested
  to create sophisticated layouts.
* a mostly [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) look, mixed with
  some [Material Design Icons](http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/icons.html).

In short, re-com attempts to provide the kind of UI basics you'd need to build a desktop-class app.



## Warning: re-com Might Not Be For You (just yet)

We build desktop-class apps to run in controlled browser environments
like [Electron](https://electron.atom.io).  So, we know we're dealing with Chrome.

If you are similar, or if you work on Intranet apps where you can mandate a modern browser,
re-com could be ideal for you, right now.

On the other hand, if you target the retail web, you will have to make your own determination, based on [availability of support for Flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox). The entire layout side of this library plus a few of the widgets rely on [Flexbox](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) which doesn't work on some older browser versions, specifically IE 9, 10, and 11 (even Edge is not quite perfect yet).

Even when it comes to modern browsers, there will be teething issues. Based on 5 minutes of
testing once a month, re-com appears to work reasonably on IE11 and Safari. 
On the other hand, Firefox (pre version 38) has all the speed of a snail on performance reducing drugs. Version 38 and beyond 
have a [fix](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1149339) for the performance problems caused by nested flexboxes,
however as per issue #49 it is still not as fast as Chrome if you are using **deeply** nested flexbox layouts 
(much more nested than our demo app).

We can also confirm that none of the components have been designed with mobile in mind, and
that there's no attempt to handle media queries.  We said we had a desktop app focus, right?

Neither have we been worried too much about code size because other design goals have
taken precedence.  Our main demo app which includes every component, plus all demo
code and plenty of yadda yadda, comes to about 167K compressed when
using `:optimizations :advanced` (700K pre-compress).
That number includes ReactJS plus the ClojureScript libs and runtime. So, everything.

## So, Without Ado Being Any Furthered ...

Still here?  Good. I'm glad we got all that negative stuff out the way.  I think you're
going to like re-com.

Start by [looking at the demo](http://re-demo.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com).


## Navigating The Source

When you are running the demo app, you'll see hyperlinks, to the right of page titles, which
take you to the associated source code.  That's a convenient way to navigate to either
the components themselves or the demo code.

When browsing more generally, look in the `src` directory or this repo, you'll notice
two sub-directories:

  - re-com - the library itself - the components
  - re-demo - the demo app, which shows how to use the components

## Useful Commands

1. Getting The Repo


   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Day8/re-com.git
   ```

   ```shell
   cd re-com
   ```

2. Compiling And Running The Demo


   ```shell
   lein dev-once
   ```

  This will run the demo, by doing: 
  - a clean 
  - a compile 
  - a load of the right `index.html` into your default browser


3. Debugging The Demo

   We love using [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) to debug.

   To begin a debug session, do this:
   ```shell
   lein dev-auto
   ```

  This will:

  - clean
  - start the [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) server & compiler  (a terminal window will be started)
  - load the right `index.html` (specialised for figwheel use)

  Your part to play in the process:

  - the initial load of `index.html` will fail because the figwheel compile hasn't yet finished. 
  - be patient - the initial compile might take anything from 10 seconds to 3 mins depending on how many dependencies need to be downloaded (how many are not yet in your local Maven repo).
  - keep an eye on the terminal started by figwheel, waiting for a green `Successfully compiled` message.  
  - you can now refresh the HTML page to see the running demo.
  
  **Devtools/Dirac**
  
  The app is pre-configured with the binaryage/devtools & binaryage/dirac dependencies and initalisations. See initial setup here [DEVTOOLS.md](/docs/DEVTOOLS.md)

  With your app running *(see Developing)* in your browser *Canary/Unstable* click on the Dirac extension icon *(you can also use standard devtools (F12) if you don't want a Dirac cljs repl)*


4. Run The (erm, modest) Tests
 
   ```shell
   lein test-once
   ```

  This will:

  - clean
  - compile the tests
  - load the required `test.html` into your default browser, so you can see the results.


5. Debug the tests:

   ```shell
   lein test-auto
   ```

  Unlike `debug` which uses figwheel, `debug-test` uses cljsbuild's `auto` for
  recompilation.  This probably isn't a good idea, but that's the way it is right now.


6. Deploy The Demo App To S3 bucket

   This will only work if you have the right credentials in your env:
   ```shell
   lein deploy-aws
   ```


## Using re-com

re-com is available from clojars. Add it to your project.clj dependencies:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/re-com/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/re-com)

You should now be able to require the `re-com.core` namespace, which exposes all of the API functions documented in the `re-demo` example app.

You'll then need to include these asset folders in your app:
https://github.com/Day8/re-com/tree/master/run/resources/public/assets

As far as your `index.html` is concerned, take inspiration from here:
https://github.com/Day8/re-com/tree/master/run/resources/public

In particular, you'll need bootstrap (assumedly via a CDN):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.css">
```

And a reference to these two CSS files (make sure `re-com.css` appears after `bootstrap.css`):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/material-design-iconic-font.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/re-com.css">
```

And a reference to the Roboto fonts (but this can be overridden relatively easily):

```html
<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700,400italic" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:400,300' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

Reagent comes bundled with a matching version of ReactJS,
so you don't need to include it explicitly.


## MVC

If you decide to use re-com, consider also using [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
(an MVC-ish framework).

Although both `re-frame` and `re-com` can be used independently of each other, they dovetail well.

## Lein Template


See [re-frame-template](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template).


## The Missing Components

* tree  (not hard, just haven't needed one yet)
* menus - there's a dropdown, but no cascading menus
* accordion
* maybe a dockable LHS navbar
* virtual grid. Straight v-box is good enough at small grids, so no problem there. But when the number of
rows gets huge, you need a widget which does virtual rows, otherwise there's just too much DOM
and there's performance problems.
Can we use [Fixed Data Tables for React](http://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table)?
* drag and drop.
* animations / transitions.  We have ideas.  They seem clunky.
* Focus management - When the user presses tab, to which field does focus move?

## Helping

1. Where the docs are wrong or fall short, write up something better. Because
   our docs take the form of an app written in ClojureScript using re-com, you're actually
   exercising your knowledge of re-com as you do this.
2. See the list of missing components above. You'll have to produce the
   component itself, including a params spec, plus the extra page in the demo app.
3. Test re-com on new browsers and iron out any quirks.  Our focus is strictly Chrome.

When creating new components, we have found it useful to use the CSS from existing
JavaScript projects (assuming their licence is compatible with MIT) and then
replace the JavaScript with ClojureScript. Reagent really is very nice.
